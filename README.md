# Clock-Project
Building a clock in Python and other coding languages. This is a very basic and easy way for me to get a sense of how to build a functional GUI and learn how apps are constructed, as well as how it differs across programming languages. Such as how the GUI is implemented in Python vs. Java, for example. There will be multiple versions to this, this is so that I can continue to make the apps not just functional, but also aesthetically appealing.
